# Sean Stobo's Toast Exercise

I initially had some issues with create-react-app (tons of missmatched dependencies and deprection warnings).
To overcome this, I flipped over to using Vite. I carefully checked the requirements, and have not touched index.html in /public, removed any dependancies, or modified /service/*. Also, using vanilla react, just Vite as a bundler.

npm install
npm run dev


## Thank you for your time! 
I hope you enjoy my submission!

Thanks again, Sean Stobo
